# jasmine-seed

A simple seed TDD project set up with Jest. There are no other bells or whistles.

##Installation

Clone the project and run `npm install` in your terminal

Once the dependencies are downloaded, you're all set. Run `npm run test` to start the test watcher. Each time you save a `*.js` file, the watcher will find and run all tests.

If you want to add new files, add source files to the `javascript` folder and test files to the `spec` folder. Conventionally, your test files should end with `*.test.js`, though this is not required.
